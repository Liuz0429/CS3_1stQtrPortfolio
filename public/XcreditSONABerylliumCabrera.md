- **2 Key Points from the SONA 2025 that I found interesting** <br>
1. Better local production and less imports
2. Kapag walang "bagong Pilipino," walang "bagong Pilipinas"
- **2 Key Points from the SONA 2025 that I found weird** <br>
1. Promises on free healthcare
2. Promises on solar power across the country
- **Reflection** 
> There were many many big promises made by President BBM in this year's SONA. Promises on lowering rice prices, promises on increasing salaries, promises on free healthcare, and talks about focusing more on improving our country's agriculture and some more. Indeed, all of these promises and big project President BBM brought up are needed by our country right now, but to be honest, I am a little concerned or confused about where our government is going to get the funds for these projects. To me, it seemed like he just kept bringing up stuff without mentioning where he would get the needed funds and support for these promises. All in all, I still hope he upholds them in the future.
> I was also weirded out while watching the SONA because when President BBM started the it, I was wondering why he didn't bring up the recent flood control issues first/early on in his speech, and to me, it almost seemed like he just wasn't going to bring up the topic at first. He talked about so many other topics or issues before bringing it up, I started thinking that he would just dodge the issue halfway through watching the SONA. Even the live chat on the Youtube stream I was watching it on was complaining about it. It was very worrying for me especially because of the recent flood issues across the Philippines around the time before the SONA 2025 happened.
- **1 Phrase for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025** 
> "So many promises!!!"
