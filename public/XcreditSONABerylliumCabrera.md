- **Reflection** 
> When President BBM started the SONA, I was wondering why he didn't bring up the recent flood control issues first/early on in his speech, and to me, it almost seemed like he just wasn't going to bring up the topic at first. He talked about so many other topics or issues before bringing it up, I started thinking that he would just dodge the issue halfway through watching the SONA. Even the live chat on the Youtube stream I was watching it on was complaining about it.
