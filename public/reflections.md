# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections

## **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**
1. **Comparison Operators** - These operators used symbols I was already familiar with, even if I had little to no experience in computer science, so they were easy to track. We had to use them for a lot of exercises, so this topic was drilled into my brain. Even then, this topic was super easy to remember.
2. **Logical Operators** - This topic gave me a little blast to the past with how it works like a truth table. I was very... traumatized about that topic before, and I hated it â€” so I was surprised to see that those truth table lessons would have a use now. Nevertheless, it was fun trying to recall how said truth tables worked to fully understand this topic.
3. **Conditional Statements** - This topic was a bit confusing to learn at first, but it was very satisfying when it clicked for me. I really liked the elegance of how switch cases worked, especially compared to the if-else statements. 
4. **Loop Control Structures** - Loops were very fun to learn and utilize. It was nice to get loops to properly work, and I liked seeing the results from these loops. The factorial coding exam of LT2 was especially fun to complete.
5. **Arithmetic Operators** - This topic was probably the topic that was utilized the most in the graded exercises, thus the syntax is easy for me to recall now. I find it really neat that the modulo operator exists.

## **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.**
1. **Number Properties** - I feel like we didn't get to use this topic enough for our exercises. They were just kind of handed out to us for use, and because of that, I don't remember the syntax very well.
2. **Nested Loops** - I feel like this would be very fun to learn further. I want to see the things I can make out of it if I understand it fully.
3. **Input/Output Statements** - For me, I don't remember the syntax very well since this topic was not utilized that much.
4. **Custom Functions** - Functions are especially useful, so I feel like it would be great if there were more discussions/practices about it.
5. **Processing Function Output** - Linking this to what I said in #4, processing function outputs are very important for utilizing functions, thus this also needs further practice and discussion.

## **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item.**
I need to find more practice exercises online about the topics I listed on the second item so that I can remember them and recall them better for future uses.
<br>

## **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
### **Effective** 
- **Graded Exercises** - These exercises really made the topics about them stick to our memory as the topics were constantly used for the graded exercises. The amount of graded exercises also helped with understanding the topics in the course.
- **Speed Tests** - It was very nice to have the teacher be around to help understand what we were doing in the speed tests and the possible corrections that could be made in our code.
### **Not Effective**
- **Kahoot Games** - It might just be a me thing since prior understanding of C++ was needed to answer these Kahoots correctly, but because of that, I only got more confused and lost whenever a Kahoot game would be hosted, since I barely understood the questions and I just had to guess.
- **Summative Assessments** - I feel like the pressure on my grades from these summative assessments made me sort of tense up and not remember anything from these activities.
